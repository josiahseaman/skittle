registerGraph('s', "Similarity Heatmap", __name__, False, False, 0.4, helpText='''This graph is a heatmap that shows how similar 
each row is to every other row on the screen.  Red represents positive correlation, blue is negative, with black being neutral.  
The red blue spectrum is normalized to account for baseline correlation from genome wide patterns. 
The structure of a heatmap is diagonally symmetrical.
The diagonal red line is self compared with self. 
Each pixel represents a comparison between two other lines.
To see which lines are involved in a comparison trace one line straight down to the diagonal and another line to the left.
The Similarity Heatmap is useful to visualize the
blocks of similar code found in the genome, such as large tandem repeats, and isochores at all scales. 
The patterns in Similarity Heatmap correlate strongly with those generated from Hi-C experiments to map chromosome territories.''')
